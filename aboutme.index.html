<h2 style="font-size: 30px;"> About me </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 15px;"> Hello! My name is <i><b style="color:red">Muzaffer Ozen</b></i> but you can call me <i><b style="color:red">Muz</b></i>. I am currently attending University of Houston as a computer science major and plan to graduate in the year 2024! On the side I have been working on projects to improve not only my coding ability, but also my ability to effectively think like a programmer. Speaking of which, you are currently viewing one of my on-going projects right now! This website was created in October 7th, 2020 with <i>zero experience</i> in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. As such, my plan for this website is to adopt it as a mode to both learn these languages and develop in them. That being said, please excuse the spaghetti code and less than ideal design! </p>
